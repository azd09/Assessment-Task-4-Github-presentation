        <h2>What is Microsoft Bi?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Data visualization has gained popularity in various fields, including libraries, where they are well-equipped to
            use data visualization tools due to their extensive knowledge base and skilled personnel.Even though integrated library systems
            provide access to visualization features, libraries commonly use different platforms like ILLiad and Google Analytics to
            access data repositories. Modern tools such as Power BI and Microsoft's Excel enhancements have introduced advanced data analysis
            and visualization capabilities, making them viable alternatives to specialized software such as Tableau.By evolving their tools,
            libraries become more adaptable and uncomplicated to manage and display data effectively.</p>
